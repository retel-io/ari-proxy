# Metrics
Ari-proxy provides service specific metrics using the [micrometer framework](http://micrometer.io) which are available via JMX or HTTP.
Both ways provide the same data.

Metrics via HTTP are in Prometheus format and are provided via the route `/metrics` on the port configured by `service.httpport` in the service config file.


## Meter descriptions

All meters can be tagged with common tags, which can be defined in the config.

* **ari-proxy.persistence.write.duration**: Measures the time it takes to persist data in the persistence store backend.
* **ari-proxy.cache.read.attempts**: Counts how often the local cache is called to lookup a call context.
* **ari-proxy.cache.read.misses**: Increases every time a lookup for call context in local cache fails and it has to be retrieved from the persistence backend
* **ari-proxy.cache.read.errors**: How often a call context lookup failed
* **ari-proxy.processor.restarts**: Tagged by `processorType`. Increases every time the command or event processing stream restarts because of errors.
* **ari-proxy.persistence.read.errors**: Errors when trying to read from persistence store
* **ari-proxy.persistence.write.duration**: Duration of writing to persistence store
* **ari-proxy.outgoing.requests**: Tagged by `method` and `path`. Counts outgoing ARI requests.
* **ari-proxy.outgoing.requests.errors**:  Tagged by `method` and `path`. Counts errors of outgoing ARI requests.
* **ari-proxy.outgoing.requests.duration**:  Tagged by `method` and `path`. Measures the duration of outgoing ARI requests.
* **ari-proxy.events**: Tagged by `eventType` and `resourceType`. Counts ARI events of the respective type.
* **ari-proxy.backing_service.availability**: Tagged by `backing_service`. Represents the health of each backing service as binary numeric value; 1=available, 0=unavailable.
